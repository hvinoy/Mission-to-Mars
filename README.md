Uses web scrapping to collect data. Uses flask and mongo db to store and transform data into web page.

Created a Jupyter Notebook file called mission_to_mars.ipynb and used this to complete all scraping and analysis tasks. 
Visited multiple websites to collect data and cpnverted the data into the necessary format.

Used MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped from the websites.
Used Splinter to navigate the sites when needed and BeautifulSoup to help find and parse out the necessary data.
