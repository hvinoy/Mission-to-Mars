Uses web scrapping to collect data. Uses flask and mongo db to store and transform data into web page.

Created a Jupyter Notebook file called mission_to_mars.ipynb and used this to complete all scraping and analysis tasks. 
Visited multiple websites to collect data and cpnverted the data into the necessary format.
